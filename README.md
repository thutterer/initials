Don't want to implement user avatar uploads but still have basic avatars to distinguish users and brigthen up your app?

Use colorful SVGs as user avatars in any Ruby and Rails application.

![demo](demo.png)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'initials'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install initials

## Usage

Call `Initials.svg("Morty Smith")` anywhere to get a colorful initials avatar SVG as string.
The avatar's background color is based on the provided name and the font-size is adjusted to fit between one and three character initials.

### Rails

No special configuration is required to work with Ruby on Rails, but for your convinience, you can add this to your `app/helpers/application_helper.rb`:

```ruby
def user_avatar(name, **options)
  Initials.svg(name, **options)
end
```

Now you can create SVGs in all views:

```erb
<%= user_avatar(current_user.name) %>
```

Initials automatically marks its created SVG strings as `html_safe`.

### Options

You can pass the following options into `Initials.svg` or your `user_avatar` helper:

```ruby
user_avatar(current_user.name,
  colors: 8,    # number of different colors, default: 12
  limit: 1,     # maximal initials length, default: 3
  shape: :rect, # background shape, default: :circle
  size: 96      # SVG height and width in pixel, default: 32
)
```

Of course, you can also use CSS to make the SVG have different sizes in different places of your HTML.
